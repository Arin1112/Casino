#Brute Force Method
1. The cards are in the format of a list of strings. Eg:["01H","13H","12C","02D","07S","03C","04H"]

2. Select 5 cards from these and find the rank

3. Repeat the process for 21 times and keep replacing the rank if the current rank is higher than the previous rank

4. If rank of 2 players is same then compare the required sum and finally announce the winner

#Improvements
1. Reduce the number of iterations. Possible ways to do that:
a. If rank found is the highest possible rank(royal flush) then stop repeating the process for other combinations.
b.


#Implemenation
1. Combination method from itertools can be used to generate all possible combinations
2. We will require 10 different functions to find rank(royal flush/straight flush/....high card) of a hand
