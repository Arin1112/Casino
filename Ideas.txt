Work out the rules of poker to be implemented
Name all the cards with the number followed by the suit
eg. 5 of hearts is 5h
decide the workflow(VVVV Imp)
lets start with taking i/p from user
store the 2 cards the player has in one list and add the cards that get revealed into the same list
therefore the max length of the list will be 7
like if the player has the 3 of clubs and the 7 of hearts the initial items in the list will be ['3c','7h']
if the cards revealed after one round are the king of clubs, the 4 of hearts and the 9 of spades the list gets appended to ['3c','7h','13c','4h','9s'] and so on.
numbering the face cards will help in determing a straight and checking which card is higher. The ace can be numbered 14 since it  is higher than the king.
the only issue in this will be to determine a straight consisting of ace,2,3,4,5. so i guess the numbers must be stored in a cyclic way. dont know how we can implement this.
we must also keep a check on the number of times a card arrives. there can only be 4 cards of a number. so if we are using random.randint then it cannot give a certain no. more than 4 times.
